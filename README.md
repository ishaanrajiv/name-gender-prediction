# Name to Gender Prediction
Train a Neural Network to predict genders from names. 
(You will need a dataset to train the model)

Basic Steps to use:

- Use word-pattern-train.py or character-nn-train.py to train the data.
- The trained model will be stored in 'model/'
- Run word-pattern-predict.py or character-nn-predict.py
- Enter the name. It will display the gender, along with confidence score.
